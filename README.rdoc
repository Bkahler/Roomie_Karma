Welcome to RoomieKarma.

RoomieKarma is an app intended to create a central location for the tracking of chores and responisibilities for households that have multiple roomates.

Members can create chore charts and supply lists. Individual roommates are emailed automcatically when its their turn to resupply shared household products. When a roommate completes a chore, they are given a score.
